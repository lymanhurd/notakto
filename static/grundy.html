    <h1>Grundy's Game</h1>
<div id="rules">
  <p>First, set up the desired number (three minimum) of dots by using the
  plus/minus buttons.  When you have the number you want, start the game by
  making a move.  The computer will then make its move.
  </p>

  <p>A move consists of breaking a group of dots into two groups with an
  unequal number of stones.  You divide a group by clicking on the dot to the
  right of the dividing point.
  </p>

  <p>For example, if you select the third dot of a group of five, you will
  divide that group into a group of two and a group of three).  The computer
  distinguishes groups by changing colors.
  </p>

  <p>The last player who can make a move, wins.  Note you cannot click on
  a group with one or two members.

    <h2>Strategy</h2>
    <p>
        The strategy is to leave your opponent with a zero nim sum where the nim
        values for each heap size are taken from the following table.  A
        discussion of how to add nimbers is <a href="nimber.html">here</a> and a
        discussion of how this table was computed is
        <a href="mex.html">here</a>.  Note that it is conjectured (in <a
        href="https://github.com/sserdoubleh/ACM/tree/master/knowledge">Winning
        Ways for Your Mathematical Plays</a>) that this
        table eventually settles down to be periodic as is the case with
        <a href="./kayles.html">Kayles</a>, this remains unproven despite Achim
        Flammenkamp having computed this table to 2<sup>35</sup> dots
