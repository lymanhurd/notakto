                    <p>Character Creator is a spreadsheet type program that allows the user
                    to change the values on the interface using rules found in Dungeons & Dragons 4th
                    Edition.</p>

                    <p>Tic Tac Toe on Python uses a self learning algorithm to get smarter after
                    every game played until it always either ties or wins games.  A user can play against
                    it using the interface.</p>

                    <p>No Tac Toe is a variant of Tic Tac Toe where both players are X and the player that gets three in a row loses.
                    It can be played with more than one board, if that happens when a player gets three in a row that board is "dead".
                    A dead board cannot be played on further and if a player kills the last board they lose.  No Tac Toe uses an algorithm
                    using formulas to determine what move would be ideal. If there are no ideal moves the program makes a move at random.
                    The program is skilled so if you make a wrong move you lose.</p>

                    <p>Lily's Checkers is a website for playing Checkers.  Currently we have the ability to play against another
                    player on the same computer and you can also play against a computer AI.  The computer AI can be chosen for either color
                    or both at the same time.</p>
