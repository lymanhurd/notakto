        <p>
        Each move divides the group into the sum of two groups.  The
        general rule for computing Nimbers is that the assigned Nimber
        is the smallest value that cannot be reached at the next
        stage.  We also know that there are no moves possible for 1
        and 2 dots so that G(1) = G(2) = 0.
	</p>
        <p>
        For example, there is a single legal move from a group of
        three and that move leads to two games whose Nimber is 0.
        Therefore the smallest number we cannot reach is 1 hence G(3)
        = 1.
        </p>
        <p>
        Starting from a row of four, there is only one legal division
        since (2, 2) is forbidden by the rules.  This leaves (1, 3)
        (or the equivalent (3, 1).  We know that G(1) = 0 and G(3) = 1
        and therefore the only Nimber we can achieve starting with a
        row of four is one.  The smallest number we <em>cannot</em>
        get is zero which is therefore the value of this position G(4)
        = 0.
        </p>
        <p>
        From 5 we can reach (1, 4) which has value 0 + 0 = 0 and we
        can reach (2, 3) which has value 0 + 1 = 1.  Therefore the
        smallest number we cannot achieve is 2 and G(5) = 2.</p>
