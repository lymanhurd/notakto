                    <p>Thank you to my fans.  A professional software developer,
                    believe it or not this is what I do on weekends for fun.  In
                    my colleagues' view, for good reasons, I am kept safely away
                    from the front end, so this is my forum to explore all the
                    things I wish I knew more about.  This is combined with a
                    passion for games and puzzles, e.g., my collaboration with Glenn on a Checkers AI.</p>
