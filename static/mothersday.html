                    about how awesome you are.  I hope you enjoy!

                <p>
                    Mom means a lot to me.  Whenever I have a problem that needs to be solved she is there.  She always takes time
                    to talk with me about important things such as work, exercise, and even some card games that I play with friends.
                    She is hard working and is an excellent role model for me.  Despite all the silly jokes I have told her over the
                    years she still laughs at all the funny ones I say today.  This and more is why I love Mom.
                </p>
